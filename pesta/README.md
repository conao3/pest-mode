# Pesta

Pesta is a little helper program that produces helpful diagnosis messages for your language and your grammar file.  Its main goal is to provide [pest.rs](https://pest.rs)-style syntax checking and a language debugger.

It currently only targets [pest-mode](https://github.com/ksqsf/pest-mode) for Emacs.
